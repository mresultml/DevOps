Jenkins is a powerful application that allows continuous integration and continuous delivery of projects, regardless of the platform you are working on.

What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous Integration is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository at regular intervals. 
This concept was meant to remove the problem of finding later occurrence of issues in the build lifecycle. Continuous integration requires the developers to have frequent builds. 

Note: The common practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should be triggered.
