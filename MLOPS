MLOps is the process of unifying the  model development(dev) and model deployment(ops) to streamline the continuose delivery of high performance models in production.

MLOps is the process of taking an experimental machine learning model into a production system.
The word is a compound of “machine learning” and the continuous development practice of DevOps in the software field. 
Machine learning models are tested and developed in isolated experimental systems. When an algorithm is ready to be launched.
MLOps is practiced between Data Scientists, DevOps, and Machine Learning engineers to transition the algorithm to production systems.

Machine Learning systems can be categorized in eight different categories: 
1. data collection
2. data processing
3. feature engineering 
4. data labelling
5. model design 
6. model training and optimization
7. endpoint deployment
8. endpoint monitoring

========================================================================================================================================================================
There are a number of goals enterprises want to achieve through MLOps systems successfully implementing ML across the enterprise, including

Deployment and automation
Reproducibility of models and predictions
Diagnostics (wrong reference - repeated)
Governance and regulatory compliance
Scalability
Collaboration
Business uses
Monitoring and management

Components of ML:
1. Data
2. ML Model
3. Code

========================================================================================================================================================================

Principles of MLOPS:

1. Automating the ML pipelines:
  To automate complete ML workflow without manual intervention.
  Things to automate: Calender events, messsaging, monitoring events, changes in data, model training code and app code

  In MLOPS we have 3 levels of automation:
    1. Manual model training and deployment
    2. ML pipeline automation
    3. CICD system to deploy, to automatically build ,test , deploy the data , ML model and ML training pipeline components.

2. Continuos X(everything):
  Continuose integration, deployment, Testing and Monitoring.

3. Versioning:
  Goal of versioning is to treat the ML Models, scripts and datasets with version control systems.
  To keep the versions of the trained model with different datasets to maintain auditable and reproducible.

4. Experiment tracking:
  In ML, experiments should be make by running multiple experiments in parellel before making any decisions of which model should be promoted to preoduction.

  Ways to achieve Experiment tracking:
  Use different branches each dedicated to seperate experiments. the output of each branch is a trained model and can be determined based on the selected metric.
        Can be achieved using GIT, weights and biasis library.      
            
5. Testing:       
    The compelete development datapipeline includes 3 components:
        - data pipeline
        - ML model pipeline
        - Application pipeline

    so, we use 3 testing scopes:
      - tests for features and data
      - Model development: To test whether the models are aligned with business objectives.
      - ML infrastructure
    
6. Monitoring:
   Monitor to assure the ML models performs as expected.
  
7. Reproducibility:
   Should produce identical results given the same input
   In every phase of ML workflow i.e ML model processing, model training, model deployment should produce identical results given the same input.

How MLOPS work:
MLOPS follows similar patterns to DEVOPS(Practice that follows seemless integration between dev cycle and overall ops process, just like devops follows the process to shortens
prod lifecycle by creating better prodducts in each iteration).MLOPS drives insights quickly using automation and Iteration models.
MLOPS is the process of taking both code and data in order to produce prediction that prescribe which deployement into prediction.

An ML model for production involves the following steps:
- Data Extraction: Select and integrate relavant data from various source for the ML task.
- Data Analysis: EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand the available data for building ML model.
- Data Preperation: Prepare the data for your ML task EDA and data cleaning where you clean the data into train , 
  validation and test sets.also apply data transformations and feature engineering to the model that solves the target task.
- Model Training: 
- Model Evolution
- Model Validation
- Serving and Monitoring

The level of automation of the above model defines the maturity of ML process.It increases the velocity of training the new model.


Advantage:
- Rapid Innovation
- Reproducible workflow
- Easy Deployment
- Higher precision
- Effective management
- ML resource management system and control
