1. Deployed many applications in ML Area
Once the source code is ready, built the code, created the docker image and Deployed multiple applications in Vessel (In staging environment) such as:
	Vessel Text extract
	GMAIST
	Vessel Batch Processor service -WIP
	Vessel NLP
	UK SMS Services
Also, working on getting access to Rancher prod to deploy some of the services in Prod environment.

2. Added custom functionalities for Kubernetes Deployments
 Written python code for abstracting storage(S3) operations like list, upload, download, delete. To create abstraction for the developer to storage services.

3. Managing Kubernetes Cluster using Python
 Written the code using python to create and expose Kubernetes APIs which performs the operations like create, delete, list and update K8s objects without using Kubectl commands.
This helps users(developers) to access K8s object from API level instead of platform level (to achieve platform abstraction).

4. Microservices Deployments using Spinnaker

5. Migration of Existing Services to Rancher 2.0
  Post migration from Rancher 1.6 to Rancher 2.0, we have migrated by redeploying several applications on vessel in new Rancher
  Recreated PV and PVC’s and assigned the persistence volumes to required applications/Services.

6. Designing & Exposing API's for Vessel NLP
  Vessel NLP is the service which was using AWS comprehend (for medical) service’s functionalities at the backend to detect some medical related characters/words in a bunch of English paragraphs. This helps to identify the patient’s medical history, treatment undergone, Medicine and dosage etc...,
	We have Designed this flow, the requests and responses, implemented by proxying AWS comprehend functions using Python Flask and deployed the service in Vessel.
